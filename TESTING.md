# Testing Guide for Graffiti Soul

This guide explains how to test your decompiled functions by patching them into the original JSRF XBE and running in xemu (Xbox emulator).

## Important: xemu is for Verification, Not the End Goal

**This testing workflow is a development tool, not the final product.**

The ultimate goal of this project is a **complete, standalone native port** that runs on modern hardware (PC, Linux, macOS, etc.) without requiring:
- The original Xbox XBE
- An emulator
- Original Xbox hardware
- Any proprietary game files

**Why test with xemu then?**

During decompilation, we need to verify that our reimplemented functions behave identically to the originals. By patching our code into the original XBE and running it in xemu, we can:
- Confirm behavioral correctness before moving to next function
- Catch bugs and mistakes early
- Ensure we're creating a matching decompilation
- See our code actually running in the game

Think of xemu testing as "unit testing" for decompilation. Once all functions are verified and the entire game is decompiled, we'll move to **Phase 3** (see README roadmap) where we replace Xbox-specific APIs with modern equivalents and create a truly standalone port.

## Overview

**Progressive Decompilation** is a technique where you gradually replace functions in the original game binary with your decompiled versions and test them to verify correctness. This approach:

- Allows incremental testing of individual functions
- Verifies that decompiled code matches original behavior
- Catches errors early in the decompilation process
- Enables you to see your code running in the actual game
- Builds confidence that the decompilation is accurate

## Prerequisites

### Required Files

You **MUST** legally own a copy of Jet Set Radio Future. You will need:

1. **Original JSRF XBE** (`default.xbe`) - Extracted from your legally owned game disc
2. **Game assets** - All data files from your retail JSRF disc

**We do not condone piracy.** Do not proceed unless you own the game.

### Required Software

1. **xemu** - Original Xbox emulator
   - Download: https://xemu.app/
   - Documentation: https://xemu.app/docs/

2. **Python 3.8+** with dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Build tools** (one of):
   - **Clang/LLVM** (recommended for Xbox builds)
   - **Visual Studio** (Windows only)
   - **GCC** (for host builds only, not Xbox-compatible)

4. **extract-xiso** (optional, for creating ISOs):
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   git clone https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso.git
   cd extract-xiso
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. && make
   sudo make install
   ```

## Setup

### 1. Extract Your Game Files

Extract files from your legally owned JSRF disc:

```bash
# Create directory for original files
mkdir -p jsrf-original

# Extract ISO (if you have ISO file)
extract-xiso -d jsrf-original/ your-jsrf.iso

# Or manually copy files from disc
cp /path/to/disc/* jsrf-original/
```

Your `jsrf-original/` directory should contain:
- `default.xbe` - The game executable
- Game data files (textures, models, sounds, etc.)

### 2. Configure Build for Xbox

The default build creates a native executable for testing compilation. For Xbox testing, enable Xbox mode:

```bash
# Create build directory for Xbox
mkdir build-xbox && cd build-xbox

# Configure for Xbox with Clang
cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DBUILD_FOR_XBOX=ON \
  -DENABLE_PATCHING=ON \
  -DORIGINAL_XBE=../jsrf-original/default.xbe

# Build
cmake --build .
```

### 3. Knowledge Base (kb.json)

The `kb.json` file tracks all discovered functions and their addresses. When you decompile a new function:

1. Add its entry to `kb.json`
2. Mark its status (`stub`, `partial`, or `complete`)
3. The build system uses this to know which functions to patch

Example entry:
```json
{
  "decl": "void subsystem_frame_update(GameState* gameState)",
  "addr": "0x123e0",
  "status": "complete",
  "notes": "Main subsystem dispatcher"
}
```

## Testing Workflow

### Standard Testing Process

```bash
# 1. Build the project
cd build-xbox
cmake --build .

# 2. Patch the XBE
cmake --build . --target patch-xbe

# 3. The patched XBE is created at:
#    build-xbox/jsrf-patched/default.xbe

# 4. Copy game data to patched directory
cp -r ../jsrf-original/* jsrf-patched/
# (This copies all game assets but overwrites default.xbe with our patched version)

# 5. Run in xemu
xemu -dvd_path jsrf-patched/
```

### What Happens During Patching

The `tools/patch.py` script:

1. **Loads original XBE** - Reads the retail game executable
2. **Loads your compiled code** - Reads functions you've decompiled
3. **Embeds new code** - Adds your compiled functions to the XBE
4. **Creates redirects** - Patches original function addresses to jump to your code
5. **Writes patched XBE** - Outputs the modified executable

### Function Status Levels

Functions in `kb.json` can have these statuses:

- **`stub`** - Function exists but has no implementation (just returns/empty)
  - Not worth patching, will crash if called

- **`partial`** - Function partially implemented, may have some TODOs
  - Can be patched for basic testing
  - May not handle all edge cases

- **`complete`** - Function fully decompiled and verified
  - Safe to patch and test
  - Should match original behavior

**Only `partial` and `complete` functions are patched by default.**

## Debugging with xemu

### Enable Debug Logging

```bash
# Run xemu with debug output
xemu -dvd_path jsrf-patched/ -full_boot -s -S
```

Flags:
- `-s` - Enable GDB server on port 1234
- `-S` - Pause at startup (wait for debugger)
- `-full_boot` - Boot through Xbox BIOS (more accurate)

### Using GDB

```bash
# In another terminal
gdb build-xbox/bin/graffiti-soul

# Connect to xemu
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234

# Set breakpoints
(gdb) break subsystem_frame_update

# Continue execution
(gdb) continue
```

### xemu Debugging Features

- **Monitor** - Press `` ` `` (backtick) to open debug monitor
- **Disassembly** - View assembly of your patched functions
- **Memory inspector** - Examine game memory in real-time
- **Performance profiling** - Measure function execution times

## Verification Strategies

### 1. Binary Comparison

Compare your compiled function against the original:

```bash
# Disassemble original function
objdump -D jsrf-original/default.xbe | grep -A 50 "123e0:"

# Disassemble your implementation
objdump -D build-xbox/bin/graffiti-soul | grep -A 50 "subsystem_frame_update"

# Compare side-by-side
diff original.asm yours.asm
```

### 2. Behavioral Testing

- Does the game boot?
- Does it reach the main menu?
- Can you start a level?
- Are there graphical glitches?
- Does it crash?

### 3. Incremental Approach

**Start small:**
1. Decompile a single, simple function
2. Mark it as `complete` in kb.json
3. Patch and test
4. If it works, move to next function
5. If it breaks, you know exactly which function is wrong

### 4. Logging

Add logging to your functions (remove before finalizing):

```cpp
void subsystem_frame_update(GameState* gameState) {
    // Debug output (Xbox has debug serial port)
    debug_printf("subsystem_frame_update called\n");

    // ... rest of function
}
```

## Common Issues

### Patching Fails

**Problem**: `patch.py` fails with error

**Solutions**:
- Verify original XBE path is correct
- Check that compiled exe exists
- Ensure kb.json is valid JSON
- Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Game Crashes Immediately

**Problem**: XBE crashes on startup in xemu

**Possible causes**:
- Function signature mismatch (wrong parameters/return type)
- Incorrect function address in kb.json
- Stack corruption
- Calling convention mismatch (stdcall vs cdecl)

**Debug**:
1. Check xemu console output for crash address
2. Compare against kb.json to identify which function
3. Review that function's decompilation

### Game Freezes

**Problem**: Game loads but freezes/hangs

**Possible causes**:
- Infinite loop in your code
- Missing function call
- Incorrect state machine logic

**Debug**:
1. Use GDB to pause and check call stack
2. Add debug output to trace execution
3. Compare your control flow against Ghidra decompilation

### Visual Glitches

**Problem**: Game runs but has graphical corruption

**Possible causes**:
- Graphics subsystem function incorrectly decompiled
- Incorrect data structure offsets
- Floating-point precision issues

**Debug**:
1. Disable patching of graphics functions
2. Binary search: disable half, test, narrow down
3. Review GameState structure offsets

## Creating an ISO for Testing

Once your patched XBE works, you can create an ISO:

```bash
# Create ISO from patched directory
extract-xiso -c jsrf-patched/ -o jsrf-patched.iso

# Boot ISO in xemu
xemu -dvd_path jsrf-patched.iso
```

## Advanced: Testing on Real Hardware

⚠️ **DANGER: Can brick your Xbox if done incorrectly**

If you have a modded Xbox:

1. FTP the `jsrf-patched` directory to your Xbox
2. Boot using a dashboard (UnleashX, XBMC, etc.)
3. Launch `default.xbe`

**Only do this if you know what you're doing and accept the risk.**

## CI/CD Testing

The project can be configured for automated testing:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt-get install -y clang lld
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Build for Xbox
        run: |
          mkdir build && cd build
          cmake .. -DBUILD_FOR_XBOX=ON
          cmake --build .

      - name: Verify compilation
        run: |
          ls -lh build/bin/graffiti-soul
          file build/bin/graffiti-soul
```

Note: Actual XBE patching and xemu testing in CI requires the original XBE, which cannot be distributed.

## Next Steps

Once you have the testing workflow set up:

1. Start with simple functions (getters, setters, utility functions)
2. Gradually work up to complex functions
3. Test frequently - after every function or two
4. Document any quirks or discoveries in kb.json notes
5. Share your findings with the community

Remember: The goal is a **matching decompilation** - your code should produce identical assembly to the original when compiled with the same compiler settings.

## Path to Native Port

Once all functions are decompiled and verified (Phase 1 & 2 complete), we'll transition to **Phase 3: Native Port**. This involves:

### 1. Platform Abstraction Layer

Create platform-independent interfaces for:
- **Graphics**: Replace Direct3D 8 with Vulkan/OpenGL/Metal
- **Audio**: Replace DirectSound with SDL2/OpenAL/modern audio APIs
- **Input**: Replace Xbox controller API with SDL2/modern input
- **File I/O**: Replace Xbox file system with standard OS APIs
- **Networking**: Add cross-platform networking (for multiplayer)

### 2. Xbox API Replacement

The current code uses Xbox-specific APIs from `XAPILIB`:
- `CreateThread` → `std::thread` or platform threads
- `QueryPerformanceCounter` → `std::chrono` or platform timers
- `XapiBootToDash` → Application exit handling
- Memory management → Standard allocators

### 3. Asset Loading

Currently assumes Xbox DVD file layout. Need to:
- Support loading from extracted game files
- Handle different endianness if needed
- Support modern file formats alongside originals
- Implement streaming for large assets

### 4. Build System Changes

Transition from Xbox-targeted build to native builds:
- Remove `-target i386-pc-win32` flags
- Remove XBE patching (no longer needed)
- Add platform-specific build configurations
- Package as standalone executables for each platform

### 5. Testing Native Port

Instead of testing in xemu:
- Run directly on your development machine
- Test on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Modern graphics testing (4K, ultrawide, etc.)

### Example: Direct3D → Vulkan Translation

Current (Xbox):
```cpp
// Uses Direct3D 8 for rendering
d3dDevice->BeginScene();
d3dDevice->DrawPrimitive(...);
d3dDevice->EndScene();
```

Future (Native):
```cpp
// Platform abstraction
renderer->BeginFrame();
renderer->DrawPrimitive(...);
renderer->EndFrame();

// Implementations for each backend:
// - VulkanRenderer
// - OpenGLRenderer
// - MetalRenderer (macOS/iOS)
// - D3D12Renderer (Windows)
```

### When to Transition?

We'll begin Phase 3 when:
- ✅ All game functions are decompiled
- ✅ All functions verified in xemu
- ✅ Game runs start-to-finish with decompiled code
- ✅ Community consensus on architecture

At that point, xemu testing becomes obsolete, and we focus entirely on the standalone native port.

---

Happy decompiling! 🎮

*Remember: xemu is a tool to help us build something better - a native port that will outlive the emulator itself.*
